# Decision-tree-Classifier
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. 
In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
We can find several variables, some of them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).
